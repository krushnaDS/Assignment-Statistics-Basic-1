    "Understanding the level of measurement of your data is crucial in data analysis for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Choosing appropriate statistical tests:\n",
    "Different levels of measurement allow for different statistical analysis. Using the wrong test on data with the wrong measurement level can lead to misleading results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're analyzing a survey that asks people to rate their satisfaction with a new product on a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). This data is ordinal. You can determine the most common rating (mode) and order the ratings from least to most satisfied (median).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you cannot calculate the average satisfaction and say, for instance, that the average customer is 3.2 satisfied. This is because the difference between a 1 and a 2 on the scale might not represent the same difference in satisfaction as the difference between a 4 and a 5. The scale doesn't tell you the exact interval between each level of satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding that the data is ordinal, you choose appropriate descriptive statistics (like mode or median) and avoid making misleading claims about the average satisfaction."
